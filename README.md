# React Native Android Crash on Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native application crashes on Android when fetching data from a remote server using `fetch`. The iOS version works without issues.

## Bug Description

A React Native application developed for both Android and iOS is encountering a crash specifically on Android devices. The crash occurs during an asynchronous data fetch operation using the `fetch` API.  The application fetches data from a REST API endpoint.  The iOS version of the application functions correctly, but the Android version crashes with no clear error message in the logs.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application on both an Android and iOS emulator/device.
3. Observe the crash on the Android emulator/device.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error handling and potentially adjusting network request settings.

## Additional Notes

Debugging this type of crash often involves examining the device logs for more detailed error messages. Network requests may sometimes fail due to permissions issues or network connectivity problems.  Consider adding more robust error handling and logging to aid in debugging.
